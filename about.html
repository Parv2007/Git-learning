And thus, Solar Power refrs to the Sun's power. But how exactly are we supposed to use the Sun's power? <img src = "Thinking.gif" style = "float: right;" height = "200px;"> Confusing, isn't it? The answer is though, simple. The photovoltaic effect is the principle behind it. In it, the sun's rays are converted into a seried of electrons with the help of photovoltaic cells and are instigated and agitated to form AC current. This AC current can then be used to power our homes, and even large factories. Presently, many companies have destined their goals to make large solar parks in India, for example, Adani Green which has already accomplished the task of making the largest solar park in India which powers almost the whole state of Tamil Nadu. It has even larger plans for the future.</b></p></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This is going to be a piece of cake as I will further explain it. For the generation of hydroelectricity, hydro electric dams are needed. In these dams, the water is allowed to flow down at a high pace from a high structure, into a water body. On falling, the water moves the turbine at the bottom by its pressure. The turbine moves to generate electricty that is transferred to the generator and ultimately, to the transformer which converts the elctricity intto a usable form. The water is then again brought up to the high-leveled structure This can be used for powering large regions without any further human intervention. Everything is automated after it's built. This method of electricity generation is not introduced much in India but I am sure, that soon, it will be.</b></p></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The electrons are then allowed to flow together, which is electricity. Cool, isn't it?</b></p></div><br><br><br><br><br><br>
